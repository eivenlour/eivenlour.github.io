            <h1>Eivenlour David, <i>BSc Computing Science Student</i></h1>
            
            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently in my third year, specializing in Computing Science at the University of Alberta. Since Chemistry and Mathematics were my favourite subjects in high school, I started off in university as a student in General Sciences with Chemistry as my major and Mathematics as my minor. It was only when I took my first CMPUT course as an option that I found a profound interest in Computing Science and started to research about it. </p>
            <p>Since almost everything has gone digital, computer scientists like software developers are vital in every type of industry leading the community to the advancements of technology that can truly change the world. So, I later switched my major to Computing Science and my minor to Chemistry instead. However, I wanted to take things even further with my career in this subject area so I decided to apply for the Software Practice program which I am now in. </p>
